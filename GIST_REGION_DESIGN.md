# A GiST opclass for skyregion: design notes

Branch: `claude/zealous-cerf-mkda2j`. Status: a working, correctness-verified
spike for one strategy (`&&`, region-region `INTERSECTS`), not a tuned or
production-ready index. See "Spike scope" below for exactly what is and isn't
built and measured.

## Why this, and why now

PR #6 added a documented recipe (`skycell_region_moc_ranges`, see
`skycell--0.9.sql`) for region-region `INTERSECTS`: explode both sides of a
join into MOC-derived `[lo,hi]` cell-id ranges and join on PostgreSQL's
built-in `int8range` GiST opclass. That closed most of a real gap (skycell
had no indexed answer at all for `a.region && b.region`) but it's a manual
recipe -- a hand-maintained side table and a hand-written join, the same
status as the older point-in-footprint MOC recipe. The natural next question,
which that PR's own text flagged as follow-up: could `skyregion` carry a real
GiST opclass of its own, so `a.region && b.region` with a plain
`CREATE INDEX ON b USING gist (region)` is index-backed with no side table
and no rewritten query at all -- the way pgSphere's `scircle`/`spoly` already
work? This document and the code alongside it answer that empirically.

## The key structural fact: skycell already computes everything a bounding
## cap needs

A GiST opclass needs a cheap, fixed-size *key* to bound an arbitrarily large
or complex indexed value -- the same role `box2df` plays for PostGIS
geometries, or `spherekey` for pg_sphere's own region types. For a region on
a sphere, the natural choice is a **bounding spherical cap**: a centre
(unit vector) and an angular radius. Two caps overlap iff the angle between
their centres is at most the sum of their radii -- exactly
`sc_region_overlaps`'s own cone-cone formula in `cover.c`, lifted to bound
*any* region kind uniformly.

Building that cap needs no new geometry:

- **Cone**: it already *is* one. `center`/`radius` are already fields on
  `sc_region`.
- **Polygon**: `sc_region_centroid()` (already public, used for ADQL
  `CENTROID`) gives a centre; the existing (previously `static`) helper
  `region_farthest()` gives the farthest vertex from a point. Called with the
  centroid as that point, it's exactly the enclosing radius -- not the
  *minimal* enclosing cap (that would need real min-enclosing-circle
  computation), but a valid one, computed by recombining two functions that
  already existed for other reasons.

This is now `sc_region_bounding_cap()` in `cover.c` (12 lines), the only
addition to the pure-math, PostgreSQL-independent side of the codebase.
Everything else lives in a new file, `ext/src/gist_region.c`, which is
ordinary GiST glue: compress/decompress/union/penalty/picksplit/same/
consistent, storage type plain `bytea` (a packed `{cx,cy,cz,radius}` struct --
no custom SQL type needed, the same choice pg_sphere itself made for its
`spherekey`, which is `bytea`-shaped in its own union/picksplit argument
declarations even though its *storage* type is nominally distinct).

Only one strategy is registered: `&&(skyregion,skyregion)`, strategy number 1.
`consistent` computes the query's own bounding cap on the fly (via
`skycell_region_from_datum` + `sc_region_bounding_cap`, exactly what
`intersects()` itself does to parse a region) and tests cap-overlap;
`recheck` is always `true`, since the cap test is a real over-approximation
(both for the polygon case above, and inherently for `&&` itself, the same
way it is for the MOC-ranges recipe or any bounding-volume index) -- GiST's
own recheck mechanism then runs the actual `intersects()` predicate
automatically, with no manual join needed to do it.

## A real bug, and what it cost to find

The first working version of `picksplit` crashed the server (`SIGSEGV`)
building an index over as few as ~160 rows -- enough to force one page
split. The cause: **`GistEntryVector`'s indexing convention differs between
`union` and `picksplit`.** For `union`, `vector[0..n-1]` are all real entries
(standard C, 0-based). For `picksplit`, `vector[0]` is a reserved slot and
real entries start at `vector[FirstOffsetNumber]` (`FirstOffsetNumber == 1`)
through `vector[n-1]` -- because `GIST_SPLITVEC.spl_left`/`spl_right` store
`OffsetNumber`s referencing tuple positions on an actual page, and
`picksplit`'s input indexing is kept consistent with that 1-based addressing
throughout, not just in the output. The first version treated `vector[0]` as
real leaf data (it's uninitialised) and crashed dereferencing it as a bytea
pointer inside `bytea_to_cap`.

Diagnosed the hard way, since a crashed backend leaves no queryable state:
added `elog(LOG, ...)` tracing (NOTICE is not reliable once the connection
that would receive it dies mid-crash) at the top of every loop iteration in
`union` and `picksplit`, reduced the reproduction to a plain 3000-row circle
table, and read the server log for the last line printed before "terminated
by signal 11" -- which was the split-count log line itself, with *zero*
per-entry lines after it, pinning the fault to the very first
`vector[0]` access. Fixed by switching `picksplit`'s loop bounds and indices
to `OffsetNumber`/`FirstOffsetNumber`/`maxoff = entryvec->n - 1` throughout,
matching the convention `spl_left`/`spl_right` already required. (A second,
initially-plausible theory -- a 4-byte-header alignment fault in the `bytea`
packing -- was ruled out first, by switching to `memcpy` and `VARDATA_ANY`;
neither actually the cause, but both are still correct, defensive choices
worth keeping regardless.)

This is the single most important finding in this document, arguably more
than the performance numbers below: **a subtly wrong GiST opclass doesn't
fail loudly or return wrong rows -- it crashes the server**, and only past a
row count large enough to force a page split, which a small smoke test
easily misses (the initial 5-row and 300-row tests both built and queried
correctly; the bug only showed up at ~3000 rows). Any future work on this
opclass, or any new one, needs a correctness test large enough to force
multiple splits before it can be trusted at all.

## Spike scope

Built and measured:

- `compress`, `decompress`, `union`, `penalty`, `same`, `consistent` (`&&`
  only), and `picksplit` (see below).
- `picksplit` is Guttman's original **linear split**: pick the two entries
  whose caps are farthest apart as seeds, then greedily assign every other
  entry to whichever seed's group needs the smaller penalty to absorb it,
  with a simple guard against a fully lopsided split. This is *correct* for
  any resulting grouping (union is always recomputed from whatever ends up on
  each side), but it is not the R*-tree-style split PostgreSQL's own `box`
  opclass uses, and tree quality -- so query performance -- has real,
  unexplored headroom left on the table.
- `cap_union2`'s general-position formula (place the merged cap's centre
  along the geodesic between the two input centres, radius =
  `(d + r1 + r2) / 2`) has a documented, un-exercised weak spot: near-
  antipodal centres (`d` approaching `pi`). A single region's own cap cannot
  trigger this (`skyregion` already forbids a cone at or beyond a hemisphere,
  and a polygon spanning one), but repeated unions of far-apart small regions
  climbing an internal tree node in principle could. Not hit in testing at
  the scale tried here; flagged rather than fixed.

Not built: `<@`/`@>` strategies (point-in-region or full containment via the
same opclass -- likely a small addition once `&&` is trusted, since the cap
math is identical, only the strategy dispatch in `consistent` would grow),
concurrent-insert/VACUUM stress testing (only single-threaded `CREATE INDEX`
and read-only querying were exercised), and any tuning pass on `picksplit`
or the `penalty` cap-area-proxy weighting.

## Correctness

A synthetic 2923-row table (mixed circles and polygons, deliberately
including clusters near both poles and straddling RA = 0/360, sizes spanning
~2 orders of magnitude) built cleanly after the picksplit fix. A full
self-join (`a.region && b.region`, ~4.3M candidate pairs after the count
filter) against the same table's own unindexed `intersects()` gave:

| indexed matches | brute-force matches | false positives | false negatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| 33,361 | 33,361 | 0 | 0 |

Separately, on this project's own 5000-row mixed footprint table (`fpr`,
2500 circle + 2500 polygon, from `bench/20_region_xmatch.sql`) against 200
probes, the GiST-indexed join and the unindexed exact predicate agreed
exactly (203 matches each) -- the same reference count `bench/21_region_
overlap.sql`'s MOC-ranges recipe and pgSphere's native `&&` already agree on.

## Performance

Same 200-probe x 5000-footprint join as `bench/21_region_overlap.sql`
(`bench/22_region_gist.sql`, same probe construction, same seed):

| approach | time | setup needed | matches |
|---|---|---|---|
| unindexed (`intersects()`) | ~1.4-1.8 s | none | 203 |
| MOC-ranges recipe (PR #6) | ~74-75 ms | side table + hand-written join | 203 |
| **this opclass** | **~80-83 ms** | `CREATE INDEX ... USING gist (region)` | 203 |
| pgSphere native `&&` | ~27-42 ms | none (native types) | 203 |

So: roughly on par with the MOC-ranges recipe's *speed*, for a materially
better *interface* -- an ordinary index and an ordinary `&&`, no side table,
no `LATERAL`, no manual recheck -- but still 2-3x behind pgSphere's own
mature, tuned opclass. Confirmed via `EXPLAIN`: the join plans as
`Nested Loop -> Index Scan using <idx> on fpr, Index Cond: (s_region &&
p.s_region)`, i.e. a genuine per-row (non-constant) indexed nested loop, the
same shape a GiST-backed join always takes -- no special-casing was needed
for "the query side isn't a literal", which is precisely the point of
building a real opclass instead of a recipe.

## Where this leaves the decision

The core hypothesis holds: `skyregion` can carry a real, standards-shaped
GiST opclass, built almost entirely from pieces the extension already had
(`sc_region_centroid`, the newly-exposed `region_farthest`, and
`sc_region_overlaps`'s own overlap formula), and it gets to roughly the same
speed as the recipe this replaces while being much nicer to use. It is not
yet faster than either the recipe or pgSphere, and the honest reason is
`picksplit` quality, not the cap-key idea itself -- a linear split reliably
builds a worse tree than a proper R*-tree-style split, and that gap is where
pgSphere's decades of tuning actually live. Closing it further is a tuning
project on top of a now-validated foundation, not a new design question.
